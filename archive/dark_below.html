							<h2>Unlocking Nightfall and Heroic</h2>
							<p>Reddit user <a href = "https://www.reddit.com/user/chrisjc">chrisjc</a> put together the guide below on how to unlock the Nightfall and Heroic for The Dark Below.</p>
							<hr>
							<p>First, go to the Tower and grab the initial quest piece from Eris. She is located to the left of where you spawn. Complete the three story quests and pick up the "kill 25 Knights or Wizards" bounty. Repeat the second DLC quest on Earth two to three times to finish it. As a tip, you can delay the death of the big enemy to spawn more Knights and Wizards. Turn it in.</p>
							<br>
							<p>Grab the three new Patrol quests that Eris will produce. Go to Earth and select Patrol. Your first stop is to the right of your initial spawn. Go through the facility and past The Divide, then burn past the Rocket Yard. Act like you're going into the Sepiks Prime strike. On your left after the first tunnel past the yard you'll find a specially marked Hive enemy. Kill it and the subsequent spawns to get your first bounty.</p>
							<br>
							<p>Next, reload the Earth Patrol to start from the beginning. Go straight ahead to the complex that was in the beta (or the campaign, really), where you kill a Wizard for the first time -- just go due north and up the hill into the complex. Right before the stairs to said Wizard room you'll find a marked Thrall in the corner. Kill it and the rest of the room for the second bounty. Do not reload, continue on through that area.</p>
							<br>
							<p>Finally, keep heading up that building and past the Wizard room. Go into the area with the original loot cave. Head into the big building due north (right next to the cave), and run until you get to the big open area of the Terrestrial Complex. Go straight ahead into that tiny landing, steal the urn, and kill the enemies that appear.</p>
							<p>After all that you'll unlock the new Strike and the Heroic/Nightfall weeklies. Just to be clear, none of the above steps past the "25 kill" bounty are located on your radar nor are they fully explained.</p>
							<br>
							<p>You do not need to wait for Xur to unlock the new weeklies.</p>

							<p><strong>TL:DR</strong> - beat the three story missions, beat the "kill 25" quest, complete all three purple Earth Patrol missions after.</p>
