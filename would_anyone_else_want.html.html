							<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="gameplay">Gameplay Features</span></h2>
							<hr>
							<ul>
								<li>Player set modifiers on missions (Halo Skulls): One thing I used to love about Halo 3 was finding the skulls and unlocking different modifiers to play the missions on. Destiny already has this system built in but tied to specific daily/weekly/playlists instead of being able to really customize them. I think they should be open to being changed at-will by the players. + throw in some good old fashion comedic ones for a laugh. <a href = "https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/2h1ic5/updated_the_big_list_of_missing_features/">Source</a></li>
								<li>Return to Orbit: Allow me to load straight to a mission FROM The Tower instead of having to return to orbit just to do this. It feels like an extra step in the process for no reason. <a href = "https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/2h1ic5/updated_the_big_list_of_missing_features/">Source</a></li>
								<li>Being able to select which area you spawn in patrol mode: A simple feature that would cut down on some time in patrol mode if you were trying to get to a particular area. <a href = "https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/2h1ic5/updated_the_big_list_of_missing_features/">Source</a></li>
								<li>Bungie pls: Create a cosmetic slot for gear. <a href = "https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/2okqjo/bungie_pls_create_a_cosmetic_slot_for_gear/">Source</a></li>
								<li>Does anyone else want a Strike Playlist with Random Modifiers? <a href = "https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/2t2ow2/does_anyone_else_want_a_strike_playlist_with/">Source</a></li>
								<li>Does Anyone Else Want Salvage As A Permanent Gametype? <a href ="https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/2nqw7t/does_anyone_else_want_salvage_as_a_permanent/">Source</a></li>
								<li>Does anyone else want Bungie to add melee animations to guns with bayonets? <a href ="https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/2p8du6/does_anyone_else_want_bungie_to_add_melee/">Source</a></li>
								<li>NEED BIGGER VAULT with NEW DLC - DeeJ please hear us out <a href ="https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/2msmp4/need_bigger_vault_with_new_dlc_deej_please_hear/">Source</a></li>
								<li>Even just a 5 slot mini-vault on my ship would save me so many tower trips. <a href ="https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/2ondgv/even_just_a_5_slot_minivault_on_my_ship_would/">Source</a></li>
								<li>Horde Mode</li>
							</ul>							
							
							<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="menu">Menu/UI</span></h2>
							<hr>
							<ul>
								<li>Down Sights Sensitivity: Allow players to have a separate sensitivity sensor whilst aiming down the sights of a gun. <a href = "https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/2h1ic5/updated_the_big_list_of_missing_features/">Source</a></li>
								<li>Options menu: Add additional sound sliders. I want to turn the music/SFX down sometimes in favor of voice chat and the game doesn't support this. <a href = "https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/2h1ic5/updated_the_big_list_of_missing_features/">Source</a></li>
								<li>Add the Grimoire and other features from Bungie.net: The amount of information NOT actually in the game is atrocious. I don't like being told to visit Bungie.net every time I unlock some more lore or want to find out what a certain crucible award is for. It should all be in-game, no question. <a href = "https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/2h1ic5/updated_the_big_list_of_missing_features/">Source</a></li>
								<li>Show progress rewards: Similar to the above point let players actually see the progress/rewards for those in-game and easily accessible. Most players don't even know you can get extra glimmer by completing these and in some cases increased drops from chests! <a href = "https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/2h1ic5/updated_the_big_list_of_missing_features/">Source</a></li>
								<li>Cut scene viewer: The only way to view some cut-scenes (such as at the Reef) is to have a whole new character go there for the first and only time.</li>
								<li>In-Game Maps: Come on Bungie this is like a staple feature of most games on the planet. You have a whole website dedicated to this feature where it can be explored like Google Maps but not even a simple map / waypoint system in-game? <a href = "https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/2h1ic5/updated_the_big_list_of_missing_features/">Source</a></li>
								<li>More information on screen: Allow me to "pin" my bounty tasks to my HUD so I can see my progress real-time instead of having to pop up my inventory and hover over the bounty. <a href = "https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/2h1ic5/updated_the_big_list_of_missing_features/">Source</a></li>
								<li>Show Vanguard/Crucible weekly counts when you highlight them in the options menu. <a href = "https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/2h1ic5/updated_the_big_list_of_missing_features/">Source</a></li>
								<li>Loadout Options: Let me set up different loadout options in case I want to switch between PvE and PvP it's a pain having to change my setup every time. <a href = "https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/2h1ic5/updated_the_big_list_of_missing_features/">Source</a></li>
								<li>More detailed post-game information, especially on strikes/raids: Let us see who really pulled their weight and done the most damage to the boss and who sat in the corner licking their wounds! Plus in crucible matches show us far more information like in Halo 3 where you could see who got the most medals and pulled off insane killing sprees and stuff! <a href = "https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/2h1ic5/updated_the_big_list_of_missing_features/">Source</a></li>
								<li>Hotkeys for items: Being able to assign your items (such as glimmer boosters+ammo) to controls rather than having to go into your inventory. eg. L3/R3+Face button activates assigned item. <a href = "https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/2h1ic5/updated_the_big_list_of_missing_features/">Source</a></li>
								<li>Revive timers on your HUD: Show how long until a player in your Fireteam revives so you know if it's worth taking the risk to getting to their Ghost. <a href = "https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/2h1ic5/updated_the_big_list_of_missing_features/">Source</a></li>
								<li>Ability to lock-in equipment: Add a simple lock to equipment so it can't be accidentally dismantled (yes this happens) <a href = "https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/2h1ic5/updated_the_big_list_of_missing_features/">Source</a></li>
								<li>Show element of weapons: Add a little elemental icon to weapons so you know what they are without highlighting them. <a href = "https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/2h1ic5/updated_the_big_list_of_missing_features/">Source</a></li>
							</ul>		
							
							<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="social">Social Features</span></h2>
							<hr>
							<ul>
								<li>Chat function: Simply put I have no idea how to arrange a team of 6 members to go to the Vault of Glass other than outwith the game. Add a damn chat room to the tower so you can organize groups with people or just sit around and chat! Or at least a LFG feature! (Looking for group) <a href = "https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/2h1ic5/updated_the_big_list_of_missing_features/">Source</a></li>
								<li>More emotions/actions: 4 actions aren't enough. Give us 16. Press left on the D-Pad brings up a quick little menu that accesses 4 more emotions or actions, same for each direction of the d-pad. <a href = "https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/2h1ic5/updated_the_big_list_of_missing_features/">Source</a></li>
							</ul>

							<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="cosmetic">Cosmetic Features</span></h2>
							<hr>
							<ul>
								<li>Remove/Show Helmet: I like showing off my robotic EXO face in the tower but I'd like to have the option to show/hide my helmet at any-time including on missions. I think my EXO looks awesome and I don't like hiding him behind a shitty looking Hunter mask and hood. I know this feature is already possible because it shows my character without his helmet and hood in cut-scenes BUT with the cape still attached! <a href = "https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/2h1ic5/updated_the_big_list_of_missing_features/">Source</a></li>
								<li>Emblems: Remove emblems as an inventory item that has to be stored and allow unlimited space for them, I think it's a complete oversight that these have to actually take up room in your inventory/storage. I still have 10+ of them sitting in my post office because of this. <a href = "https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/2h1ic5/updated_the_big_list_of_missing_features/">Source</a></li>
								<li>Let me gain reputation for whatever faction I like while wearing a cosmetically pleasing piece of gear. I don't mind having to buy something for a faction and wearing it to gain reputation but I don't like being restricted to it cosmetically for the duration. What's the point in paying 25 motes of light for a nice mark when you need to wear the faction mark for the reputation? <a href = "https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/2h1ic5/updated_the_big_list_of_missing_features/">Source</a></li>
								<li>Apply shaders to individual pieces of equipment (including weapons) instead of blanket coloring. <a href = "https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/2h1ic5/updated_the_big_list_of_missing_features/">Source</a></li>
							</ul>
							
							<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="crucible">The Crucible/Multiplayer</span></h2>
							<hr>
							<ul>
								<li>Map Voting: Seriously, it has to be added. I have no idea why this wasn't an essential part of the process before the game launched. Sure you're going to see a bias towards certain maps but that will tell you that there is something about those maps that players don't like and something that should be addressed in future maps. <a href = "https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/2h1ic5/updated_the_big_list_of_missing_features/">Source</a></li>
								<li>Transparency on the item rewards post-game, is it all just RNG? It feels outright crappy when you are having the game of your life and your reward is watching your team-mates getting all the goodies! <a href = "https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/2h1ic5/updated_the_big_list_of_missing_features/">Source</a></li>
								<li>Clan features IN-GAME: Why the hell do I need to go to bungie.net to join a clan (which was a pain to do in in the first place) then SET it as my PS4 clan and only then it shows up in-game next to my name with absolutely no other information at all. There isn't even a clan tab where I can see my clan-mates or other information. <a href = "https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/2h1ic5/updated_the_big_list_of_missing_features/">Source</a></li>
								<li>Additional from above, clan chatroom. This feature is available on Bungie.net but would also be very nice in-game especially if it was accessible from the character menu at any time during gameplay. <a href = "https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/2h1ic5/updated_the_big_list_of_missing_features/">Source</a></li>
								<li>Matchmaking in all strikes/weekly events. In the event that you enter one of these events if you don't have a full fireteam I would like to be automatically matched with others doing the same event. Or at least asked by the game if I'd like to be matched with other players. <a href = "https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/2h1ic5/updated_the_big_list_of_missing_features/">Source</a></li>
							</ul>
							
							<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="other">Other</span></h2>
							<hr>
							<ul>
								<li>Flashlight: Let me turn my damn flashlight on and off whenever I want. <a href = "https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/2h1ic5/updated_the_big_list_of_missing_features/">Source</a></li>
								<li>SKIP CUT SCENES can't believe I forgot this one. Seriously with such a large number of repetitiveness in the game you really need to let us skip them. <a href = "https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/2h1ic5/updated_the_big_list_of_missing_features/">Source</a></li>
								<li>Beards</li>
